Sure, I can help you with that. Here are the definitions and examples of the different types of
operators in Dart:

**Arithmetic Operators**

These operators are used to perform arithmetic operations on numbers, such as addition, subtraction,
multiplication, division, and modulus.

* **+** (Addition): Adds two numbers. For example, `5 + 2 = 7`.
* **-** (Subtraction): Subtracts two numbers. For example, `5 - 2 = 3`.
* **\*** (Multiplication): Multiplies two numbers. For example, `5 * 2 = 10`.
* **/** (Division): Divides two numbers. For example, `5 / 2 = 2.5`.
* **%** (Modulus): Calculates the remainder of division of two numbers. For example, `5 % 2 = 1`.

**Relational Operators**

These operators are used to compare two values and determine their relationship, such as greater
than, less than, equal to, and not equal to.

* **>** (Greater than): Returns true if the left operand is greater than the right operand. For
  example, `5 > 2` is true.
* **<** (Less than): Returns true if the left operand is less than the right operand. For
  example, `5 < 2` is false.
* **>=** (Greater than or equal to): Returns true if the left operand is greater than or equal to
  the right operand. For example, `5 >= 2` is true.
* **<=** (Less than or equal to): Returns true if the left operand is less than or equal to the
  right operand. For example, `5 <= 2` is false.
* **==** (Equal to): Returns true if the left operand is equal to the right operand. For
  example, `5 == 2` is false.
* **!=** (Not equal to): Returns true if the left operand is not equal to the right operand. For
  example, `5 != 2` is true.

**Type Test Operators**

These operators are used to check the type of a value, such as whether it is an integer, a string,
or a list.

* **is** (Type test): Returns true if the left operand is of the specified type. For
  example, `5 is int` is true.
* **is!** (Type test): Returns true if the left operand is not of the specified type. For
  example, `5 is! String` is true.

**Bitwise Operators**

These operators are used to perform bitwise operations on numbers, such as AND, OR, XOR, and NOT.

* **&** (Bitwise AND): Performs a bitwise AND operation on two numbers. For example, `5 & 2 = 0`.
* **|** (Bitwise OR): Performs a bitwise OR operation on two numbers. For example, `5 | 2 = 7`.
* **^** (Bitwise XOR): Performs a bitwise XOR operation on two numbers. For example, `5 ^ 2 = 3`.
* **~** (Bitwise NOT): Performs a bitwise NOT operation on a number. For example, `~5 = -6`.
* **<<** (Bitwise left shift): Shifts the left operand left by the number of bits specified by the
  right operand. For example, `5 << 1 = 10`.
* **>>** (Bitwise right shift): Shifts the left operand right by the number of bits specified by the
  right operand. For example, `5 >> 1 = 2`.

**Assignment Operators**

These operators are used to assign values to variables.

* **=** (Assignment): Assigns the value of the right operand to the left operand. For
  example, `var x = 5`.
* **??=** (Null-aware assignment): Assigns the value of the right operand to the left operand only
  if the left operand is null. For example, `var x; x ??= 5`.

**Logical Operators**

These operators are used to combine two or more logical expressions, such as AND, OR, and NOT.

* **&&** (Logical AND): Returns true if both operands are true. For example, `5 > 2 && 3 < 4` is
  true.
* **||** (Logical OR): Returns true if either operand is true. For example, `5 > 2 || 3 < 4` is
  true.
* **!** (Logical NOT): Returns the opposite of the operand.
  You are right. I missed the conditional operator `? :` and the cascade notation operator `..` in
  my previous response. Here are the definitions and examples of these operators:

**Conditional Operator**

The conditional operator is used to execute one statement if a condition is true and another
statement if the condition is false. The syntax of the conditional operator is:

```
condition ? statement1 : statement2
```

For example, the following code will print "Hello" if the variable `x` is greater than 10, and "
Goodbye" if it is not:

```
var x = 5;

print(x > 10 ? "Hello" : "Goodbye");
```

**Cascade Notation Operator**

The cascade notation operator is used to perform multiple methods on the same object in a single
line of code. The syntax of the cascade notation operator is:

```
object..method1()..method2()...
```

For example, the following code will set the value of the `name` property of the `person` object
to "John Doe", and then print the value of the `name` property:

```
var person = new Person();

person
  ..name = "John Doe"
  ..printName();
```

I hope this helps!
