// Operators in Dart are symbols used to perform operations on variables.
// Each operator defines how the operands (data values) will be processed to produce a result.

// Operands : It represents the data.
// Operator : It represents how the operands will be processed to produce a value.
// For example, in the expression 2 + 3, 2 and 3 are operands, and + is the operator.

/// Different types of operators in Dart:
/// The following are the various types of operators in Dart:
///
/// 1. Arithmetic Operators
/// 2. Relational Operators
/// 3. Type Test Operators
/// 4. Bitwise Operators
/// 5. Assignment Operators
/// 6. Logical Operators
/// 7. Conditional Operator
/// 8. Cascade Notation Operator

/// 1. **Addition (+):** This operator is used to add two operands together.
///
/// 2. **Subtraction (-):** This operator is used to subtract the second operand from the first operand.
///
/// 3. **Unary Minus (-expr):** The unary minus operator is used to reverse the sign of an expression. For example, `-5` would reverse the sign of `5`.
///
/// 4. **Multiplication (*):** This operator is used to multiply two operands.
///
/// 5. **Division (/):** This operator is used to divide the first operand by the second operand.
///
/// 6. **Integer Division (~/:** The integer division operator is used to divide the first operand by the second operand, but it returns the result as an integer, discarding any fractional part. For example, `5 ~/ 2` would result in `2`.
///
/// 7. **Modulus (%):** The modulus operator is used to find the remainder when the first operand is divided by the second operand. For example, `5 % 2` would result in `1`, as the remainder of dividing 5 by 2 is 1.
